CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect
the Git commands' behavior. The `.git/config` file in each repository
is used to store the configuration for that repository, and
`$HOME/.gitconfig` is used to store a per-user configuration as
fallback values for the `.git/config` file. The file `/etc/gitconfig`
can be used to store a system-wide default configuration.

The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing
and the porcelains. The variables are divided into sections, wherein
the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last
dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last
dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric
characters and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.  Some
variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is
multivalued.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly
ignored.  The '#' and ';' characters begin comments to the end of line,
blank lines are ignored.

The file consists of sections and variables.  A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
section begins.  Section names are case-insensitive.  Only alphanumeric
characters, `-` and `.` are allowed in section names.  Each variable
must belong to some section, which means that there must be a section
header before the first setting of a variable.

Sections can be further divided into subsections.  To begin a subsection
put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name,
in the section header, like in the example below:

--------
	[section "subsection"]

--------

Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except
newline and the null byte. Doublequote `"` and backslash can be included
by escaping them as `\"` and `\\`, respectively. Backslashes preceding
other characters are dropped when reading; for example, `\t` is read as
`t` and `\0` is read as `0` Section headers cannot span multiple lines.
Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection. You
can have `[section]` if you have `[section "subsection"]`, but you don't
need to.

There is also a deprecated `[section.subsection]` syntax. With this
syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
restrictions as section names.

All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section
header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form
'name = value' (or just 'name', which is a short-hand to say that
the variable is the boolean "true").
The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters
and `-`, and must start with an alphabetic character.

A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by
ending it with a `\`; the backquote and the end-of-line are
stripped.  Leading whitespaces after 'name =', the remainder of the
line after the first comment character '#' or ';', and trailing
whitespaces of the line are discarded unless they are enclosed in
double quotes.  Internal whitespaces within the value are retained
verbatim.

Inside double quotes, double quote `"` and backslash `\` characters
must be escaped: use `\"` for `"` and `\\` for `\`.

The following escape sequences (beside `\"` and `\\`) are recognized:
`\n` for newline character (NL), `\t` for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB)
and `\b` for backspace (BS).  Other char escape sequences (including octal
escape sequences) are invalid.


Includes
~~~~~~~~

The `include` and `includeIf` sections allow you to include config
directives from another source. These sections behave identically to
each other with the exception that `includeIf` sections may be ignored
if their condition does not evaluate to true; see "Conditional includes"
below.

You can include a config file from another by setting the special
`include.path` (or `includeIf.*.path`) variable to the name of the file
to be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is
subject to tilde expansion. These variables can be given multiple times.

The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if they
had been found at the location of the include directive. If the value of the
variable is a relative path, the path is considered to
be relative to the configuration file in which the include directive
was found.  See below for examples.

Conditional includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can include a config file from another conditionally by setting a
`includeIf.<condition>.path` variable to the name of the file to be
included.

The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some data
whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported keywords
are:

`gitdir`::

	The data that follows the keyword `gitdir:` is used as a glob
	pattern. If the location of the .git directory matches the
	pattern, the include condition is met.
+
The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from `$GIT_DIR`
environment variable. If the repository is auto discovered via a .git
file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git location
would be the final location where the .git directory is, not where the
.git file is.
+
The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two additional
ones, `**/` and `/**`, that can match multiple path components. Please
refer to linkgit:gitignore[5] for details. For convenience:

 * If the pattern starts with `~/`, `~` will be substituted with the
   content of the environment variable `HOME`.

 * If the pattern starts with `./`, it is replaced with the directory
   containing the current config file.

 * If the pattern does not start with either `~/`, `./` or `/`, `**/`
   will be automatically prepended. For example, the pattern `foo/bar`
   becomes `**/foo/bar` and would match `/any/path/to/foo/bar`.

 * If the pattern ends with `/`, `**` will be automatically added. For
   example, the pattern `foo/` becomes `foo/**`. In other words, it
   matches "foo" and everything inside, recursively.

`gitdir/i`::
	This is the same as `gitdir` except that matching is done
	case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file sytems)

A few more notes on matching via `gitdir` and `gitdir/i`:

 * Symlinks in `$GIT_DIR` are not resolved before matching.

 * Both the symlink & realpath versions of paths will be matched
   outside of `$GIT_DIR`. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to
   /mnt/storage/git, both `gitdir:~/git` and `gitdir:/mnt/storage/git`
   will match.
+
This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in
v2.13.0, which only matched the realpath version. Configuration that
wants to be compatible with the initial release of this feature needs
to either specify only the realpath version, or both versions.

 * Note that "../" is not special and will match literally, which is
   unlikely what you want.

	; affected by the condition
	[includeIf "gitdir:/path/to/group/"]
		path = foo.inc

Values
~~~~~~

Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there
are variables that take values of specific types and there are rules
as to how to spell them.

boolean::

       When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many
       synonyms are accepted for 'true' and 'false'; these are all
       case-insensitive.

	true;; Boolean true literals are `yes`, `on`, `true`,
		and `1`.  Also, a variable defined without `= <value>`
		is taken as true.

	false;; Boolean false literals are `no`, `off`, `false`,
		`0` and the empty string.
+
When converting a value to its canonical form using the `--type=bool` type
specifier, 'git config' will ensure that the output is "true" or
"false" (spelled in lowercase).

integer::
       The value for many variables that specify various sizes can
       be suffixed with `k`, `M`,... to mean "scale the number by
       1024", "by 1024x1024", etc.

color::
       The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of
       colors (at most two, one for foreground and one for background)
       and attributes (as many as you want), separated by spaces.
+
The basic colors accepted are `normal`, `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`,
`blue`, `magenta`, `cyan` and `white`.  The first color given is the
foreground; the second is the background.
+
Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use ANSI
256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support this).  If
your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit RGB values as
hex, like `#ff0ab3`.
+
The accepted attributes are `bold`, `dim`, `ul`, `blink`, `reverse`,
`italic`, and `strike` (for crossed-out or "strikethrough" letters).
The position of any attributes with respect to the colors
(before, after, or in between), doesn't matter. Specific attributes may
be turned off by prefixing them with `no` or `no-` (e.g., `noreverse`,
`no-ul`, etc).
+
An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This can be used
to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color entirely.
+
For git's pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant to be reset
at the beginning of each item in the colored output. So setting
`color.decorate.branch` to `black` will paint that branch name in a
plain `black`, even if the previous thing on the same output line (e.g.
opening parenthesis before the list of branch names in `log --decorate`
output) is set to be painted with `bold` or some other attribute.
However, custom log formats may do more complicated and layered
coloring, and the negated forms may be useful there.

pathname::
	A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a
	string that begins with "`~/`" or "`~user/`", and the usual
	tilde expansion happens to such a string: `~/`
	is expanded to the value of `$HOME`, and `~user/` to the
	specified user's home directory.


Variables
~~~~~~~~~

Note that this list is non-comprehensive and not necessarily complete.
For command-specific variables, you will find a more detailed description
in the appropriate manual page.

Other git-related tools may and do use their own variables.  When
inventing new variables for use in your own tool, make sure their
names do not conflict with those that are used by Git itself and
other popular tools, and describe them in your documentation.

checkout.defaultRemote::
	When you run 'git checkout <something>' and only have one
	remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and
	tracking e.g. 'origin/<something>'. This stops working as soon
	as you have more than one remote with a '<something>'
	reference. This setting allows for setting the name of a
	preferred remote that should always win when it comes to
	disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to
	`origin`.
+
Currently this is used by linkgit:git-checkout[1] when 'git checkout
<something>' will checkout the '<something>' branch on another remote,
and by linkgit:git-worktree[1] when 'git worktree add' refers to a
remote branch. This setting might be used for other checkout-like
commands or functionality in the future.

checkout.optimizeNewBranch::
	Optimizes the performance of "git checkout -b <new_branch>" when
	using sparse-checkout.  When set to true, git will not update the
	repo based on the current sparse-checkout settings.  This means it
	will not update the skip-worktree bit in the index nor add/remove
	files in the working directory to reflect the current sparse checkout
	settings nor will it show the local changes.

clean.requireForce::
	A boolean to make git-clean do nothing unless given -f,
	-i or -n.   Defaults to true.

color.advice::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in hints (e.g. when a push
	failed, see `advice.*` for a list).  May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors
	are used only when the error output goes to a terminal. If
	unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.advice.hint::
	Use customized color for hints.

color.blame.highlightRecent::
	This can be used to color the metadata of a blame line depending
	on age of the line.
+
This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color and date settings,
starting and ending with a color, the dates should be set from oldest to newest.
The metadata will be colored given the colors if the the line was introduced
before the given timestamp, overwriting older timestamped colors.
+
Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as well, e.g.
2.weeks.ago is valid to address anything older than 2 weeks.
+
It defaults to 'blue,12 month ago,white,1 month ago,red', which colors
everything older than one year blue, recent changes between one month and
one year old are kept white, and lines introduced within the last month are
colored red.

color.blame.repeatedLines::
	Use the customized color for the part of git-blame output that
	is repeated meta information per line (such as commit id,
	author name, date and timezone). Defaults to cyan.

color.branch::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
	linkgit:git-branch[1]. May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors are used
	only when the output is to a terminal. If unset, then the
	value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.branch.<slot>::
	Use customized color for branch coloration. `<slot>` is one of
	`current` (the current branch), `local` (a local branch),
	`remote` (a remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/),
	`upstream` (upstream tracking branch), `plain` (other
	refs).

color.diff::
	Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to patches.
	If this is set to `always`, linkgit:git-diff[1],
	linkgit:git-log[1], and linkgit:git-show[1] will use color
	for all patches.  If it is set to `true` or `auto`, those
	commands will only use color when output is to the terminal.
	If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by
	default).
+
This does not affect linkgit:git-format-patch[1] or the
'git-diff-{asterisk}' plumbing commands.  Can be overridden on the
command line with the `--color[=<when>]` option.

color.diff.<slot>::
	Use customized color for diff colorization.  `<slot>` specifies
	which part of the patch to use the specified color, and is one
	of `context` (context text - `plain` is a historical synonym),
	`meta` (metainformation), `frag`
	(hunk header), 'func' (function in hunk header), `old` (removed lines),
	`new` (added lines), `commit` (commit headers), `whitespace`
	(highlighting whitespace errors), `oldMoved` (deleted lines),
	`newMoved` (added lines), `oldMovedDimmed`, `oldMovedAlternative`,
	`oldMovedAlternativeDimmed`, `newMovedDimmed`, `newMovedAlternative`
	`newMovedAlternativeDimmed` (See the '<mode>'
	setting of '--color-moved' in linkgit:git-diff[1] for details),
	`contextDimmed`, `oldDimmed`, `newDimmed`, `contextBold`,
	`oldBold`, and `newBold` (see linkgit:git-range-diff[1] for details).

color.decorate.<slot>::
	Use customized color for 'git log --decorate' output.  `<slot>` is one
	of `branch`, `remoteBranch`, `tag`, `stash` or `HEAD` for local
	branches, remote-tracking branches, tags, stash and HEAD, respectively
	and `grafted` for grafted commits.

color.grep::
	When set to `always`, always highlight matches.  When `false` (or
	`never`), never.  When set to `true` or `auto`, use color only
	when the output is written to the terminal.  If unset, then the
	value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.grep.<slot>::
	Use customized color for grep colorization.  `<slot>` specifies which
	part of the line to use the specified color, and is one of
+
--
`context`;;
	non-matching text in context lines (when using `-A`, `-B`, or `-C`)
`filename`;;
	filename prefix (when not using `-h`)
`function`;;
	function name lines (when using `-p`)
`lineNumber`;;
	line number prefix (when using `-n`)
`column`;;
	column number prefix (when using `--column`)
`match`;;
	matching text (same as setting `matchContext` and `matchSelected`)
`matchContext`;;
	matching text in context lines
`matchSelected`;;
	matching text in selected lines
`selected`;;
	non-matching text in selected lines
`separator`;;
	separators between fields on a line (`:`, `-`, and `=`)
	and between hunks (`--`)
--

color.interactive::
	When set to `always`, always use colors for interactive prompts
	and displays (such as those used by "git-add --interactive" and
	"git-clean --interactive"). When false (or `never`), never.
	When set to `true` or `auto`, use colors only when the output is
	to the terminal. If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is
	used (`auto` by default).

color.interactive.<slot>::
	Use customized color for 'git add --interactive' and 'git clean
	--interactive' output. `<slot>` may be `prompt`, `header`, `help`
	or `error`, for four distinct types of normal output from
	interactive commands.

color.pager::
	A boolean to enable/disable colored output when the pager is in
	use (default is true).

color.push::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in push errors. May be set to
	`always`, `false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which
	case colors are used only when the error output goes to a terminal.
	If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.push.error::
	Use customized color for push errors.

color.remote::
	If set, keywords at the start of the line are highlighted. The
	keywords are "error", "warning", "hint" and "success", and are
	matched case-insensitively. May be set to `always`, `false` (or
	`never`) or `auto` (or `true`). If unset, then the value of
	`color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.remote.<slot>::
	Use customized color for each remote keyword. `<slot>` may be
	`hint`, `warning`, `success` or `error` which match the
	corresponding keyword.

color.showBranch::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
	linkgit:git-show-branch[1]. May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors are used
	only when the output is to a terminal. If unset, then the
	value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.status::
	A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
	linkgit:git-status[1]. May be set to `always`,
	`false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which case colors are used
	only when the output is to a terminal. If unset, then the
	value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.status.<slot>::
	Use customized color for status colorization. `<slot>` is
	one of `header` (the header text of the status message),
	`added` or `updated` (files which are added but not committed),
	`changed` (files which are changed but not added in the index),
	`untracked` (files which are not tracked by Git),
	`branch` (the current branch),
	`nobranch` (the color the 'no branch' warning is shown in, defaulting
	to red),
	`localBranch` or `remoteBranch` (the local and remote branch names,
	respectively, when branch and tracking information is displayed in the
	status short-format), or
	`unmerged` (files which have unmerged changes).

color.transport::
	A boolean to enable/disable color when pushes are rejected. May be
	set to `always`, `false` (or `never`) or `auto` (or `true`), in which
	case colors are used only when the error output goes to a terminal.
	If unset, then the value of `color.ui` is used (`auto` by default).

color.transport.rejected::
	Use customized color when a push was rejected.

color.ui::
	This variable determines the default value for variables such
	as `color.diff` and `color.grep` that control the use of color
	per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn
	configuration to set a default for the `--color` option.  Set it
	to `false` or `never` if you prefer Git commands not to use
	color unless enabled explicitly with some other configuration
	or the `--color` option. Set it to `always` if you want all
	output not intended for machine consumption to use color, to
	`true` or `auto` (this is the default since Git 1.8.4) if you
	want such output to use color when written to the terminal.

column.ui::
	Specify whether supported commands should output in columns.
	This variable consists of a list of tokens separated by spaces
	or commas:
+
These options control when the feature should be enabled
(defaults to 'never'):
+
--
`always`;;
	always show in columns
`never`;;
	never show in columns
`auto`;;
	show in columns if the output is to the terminal
--
+
These options control layout (defaults to 'column').  Setting any
of these implies 'always' if none of 'always', 'never', or 'auto' are
specified.
+
--
`column`;;
	fill columns before rows
`row`;;
	fill rows before columns
`plain`;;
	show in one column
--
+
Finally, these options can be combined with a layout option (defaults
to 'nodense'):
+
--
`dense`;;
	make unequal size columns to utilize more space
`nodense`;;
	make equal size columns
--

column.branch::
	Specify whether to output branch listing in `git branch` in columns.
	See `column.ui` for details.

column.clean::
	Specify the layout when list items in `git clean -i`, which always
	shows files and directories in columns. See `column.ui` for details.

column.status::
	Specify whether to output untracked files in `git status` in columns.
	See `column.ui` for details.

column.tag::
	Specify whether to output tag listing in `git tag` in columns.
	See `column.ui` for details.

commit.cleanup::
	This setting overrides the default of the `--cleanup` option in
	`git commit`. See linkgit:git-commit[1] for details. Changing the
	default can be useful when you always want to keep lines that begin
	with comment character `#` in your log message, in which case you
	would do `git config commit.cleanup whitespace` (note that you will
	have to remove the help lines that begin with `#` in the commit log
	template yourself, if you do this).

commit.gpgSign::

	A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed.
	Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can
	result in a large number of commits being signed. It may be
	convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase
	several times.

commit.status::
	A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the
	commit message template when using an editor to prepare the commit
	message.  Defaults to true.

commit.template::
	Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for
	new commit messages.

commit.verbose::
	A boolean or int to specify the level of verbose with `git commit`.
	See linkgit:git-commit[1].

credential.helper::
	Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
	password credential is needed; the helper may consult external
	storage to avoid prompting the user for the credentials. Note
	that multiple helpers may be defined. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7]
	for details.

credential.useHttpPath::
	When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of an http
	or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for more information.

credential.username::
	If no username is set for a network authentication, use this username
	by default. See credential.<context>.* below, and
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7].

credential.<url>.*::
	Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively to
	some credentials. For example "credential.https://example.com.username"
	would set the default username only for https connections to
	example.com. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for details on how URLs are
	matched.

credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP::
	Tell git-credential-cache--daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of quitting.

completion.commands::
	This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove
	commands from the list of completed commands. Normally only
	porcelain commands and a few select others are completed. You
	can add more commands, separated by space, in this
	variable. Prefixing the command with '-' will remove it from
	the existing list.

include::diff-config.txt[]

difftool.<tool>.path::
	Override the path for the given tool.  This is useful in case
	your tool is not in the PATH.

difftool.<tool>.cmd::
	Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool.
	The specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
	variables available:  'LOCAL' is set to the name of the temporary
	file containing the contents of the diff pre-image and 'REMOTE'
	is set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents
	of the diff post-image.

difftool.prompt::
	Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

fastimport.unpackLimit::
	If the number of objects imported by linkgit:git-fast-import[1]
	is below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into
	loose object files.  However if the number of imported objects
	equals or exceeds this limit then the pack will be stored as a
	pack.  Storing the pack from a fast-import can make the import
	operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems.  If
	not set, the value of `transfer.unpackLimit` is used instead.

include::fetch-config.txt[]

include::format-config.txt[]

filter.<driver>.clean::
	The command which is used to convert the content of a worktree
	file to a blob upon checkin.  See linkgit:gitattributes[5] for
	details.

filter.<driver>.smudge::
	The command which is used to convert the content of a blob
	object to a worktree file upon checkout.  See
	linkgit:gitattributes[5] for details.

fsck.<msg-id>::
	During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which
	wouldn't be generated by current versions of git, and which
	wouldn't be sent over the wire if `transfer.fsckObjects` was
	set. This feature is intended to support working with legacy
	repositories containing such data.
+
Setting `fsck.<msg-id>` will be picked up by linkgit:git-fsck[1], but
to accept pushes of such data set `receive.fsck.<msg-id>` instead, or
to clone or fetch it set `fetch.fsck.<msg-id>`.
+
The rest of the documentation discusses `fsck.*` for brevity, but the
same applies for the corresponding `receive.fsck.*` and
`fetch.<msg-id>.*`. variables.
+
Unlike variables like `color.ui` and `core.editor` the
`receive.fsck.<msg-id>` and `fetch.fsck.<msg-id>` variables will not
fall back on the `fsck.<msg-id>` configuration if they aren't set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances
all three of them they must all set to the same values.
+
When `fsck.<msg-id>` is set, errors can be switched to warnings and
vice versa by configuring the `fsck.<msg-id>` setting where the
`<msg-id>` is the fsck message ID and the value is one of `error`,
`warn` or `ignore`. For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning
with the message ID, e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer line
- missing email" means that setting `fsck.missingEmail = ignore` will
hide that issue.
+
In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with problems
with `fsck.skipList`, instead of listing the kind of breakages these
problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will
allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.
+
Setting an unknown `fsck.<msg-id>` value will cause fsck to die, but
doing the same for `receive.fsck.<msg-id>` and `fetch.fsck.<msg-id>`
will only cause git to warn.

fsck.skipList::
	The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated SHA-1 per
	line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should
	be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments ('#'), empty
	lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything
	but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.
+
This feature is useful when an established project should be accepted
despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored
such as invalid committer email addresses.  Note: corrupt objects
cannot be skipped with this setting.
+
Like `fsck.<msg-id>` this variable has corresponding
`receive.fsck.skipList` and `fetch.fsck.skipList` variants.
+
Unlike variables like `color.ui` and `core.editor` the
`receive.fsck.skipList` and `fetch.fsck.skipList` variables will not
fall back on the `fsck.skipList` configuration if they aren't set. To
uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances
all three of them they must all set to the same values.
+
Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names
list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names
could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether
the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search
implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted
list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of
your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation
is used instead, so there's now no reason to pre-sort the list.

gc.aggressiveDepth::
	The depth parameter used in the delta compression
	algorithm used by 'git gc --aggressive'.  This defaults
	to 50.

gc.aggressiveWindow::
	The window size parameter used in the delta compression
	algorithm used by 'git gc --aggressive'.  This defaults
	to 250.

gc.auto::
	When there are approximately more than this many loose
	objects in the repository, `git gc --auto` will pack them.
	Some Porcelain commands use this command to perform a
	light-weight garbage collection from time to time.  The
	default value is 6700.  Setting this to 0 disables it.

gc.autoPackLimit::
	When there are more than this many packs that are not
	marked with `*.keep` file in the repository, `git gc
	--auto` consolidates them into one larger pack.  The
	default	value is 50.  Setting this to 0 disables it.

gc.autoDetach::
	Make `git gc --auto` return immediately and run in background
	if the system supports it. Default is true.

gc.bigPackThreshold::
	If non-zero, all packs larger than this limit are kept when
	`git gc` is run. This is very similar to `--keep-base-pack`
	except that all packs that meet the threshold are kept, not
	just the base pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of
	'k', 'm', or 'g' are supported.
+
Note that if the number of kept packs is more than gc.autoPackLimit,
this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except the base pack
will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go below
gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected again.

gc.writeCommitGraph::
	If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
	linkgit:git-gc[1] is run. When using linkgit:git-gc[1]
	'--auto' the commit-graph will be updated if housekeeping is
	required. Default is false. See linkgit:git-commit-graph[1]
	for details.

gc.logExpiry::
	If the file gc.log exists, then `git gc --auto` will print
	its content and exit with status zero instead of running
	unless that file is more than 'gc.logExpiry' old.  Default is
	"1.day".  See `gc.pruneExpire` for more ways to specify its
	value.

gc.packRefs::
	Running `git pack-refs` in a repository renders it
	unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb
	transports such as HTTP.  This variable determines whether
	'git gc' runs `git pack-refs`. This can be set to `notbare`
	to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set to a
	boolean value.  The default is `true`.

gc.pruneExpire::
	When 'git gc' is run, it will call 'prune --expire 2.weeks.ago'.
	Override the grace period with this config variable.  The value
	"now" may be used to disable this grace period and always prune
	unreachable objects immediately, or "never" may be used to
	suppress pruning.  This feature helps prevent corruption when
	'git gc' runs concurrently with another process writing to the
	repository; see the "NOTES" section of linkgit:git-gc[1].

gc.worktreePruneExpire::
	When 'git gc' is run, it calls
	'git worktree prune --expire 3.months.ago'.
	This config variable can be used to set a different grace
	period. The value "now" may be used to disable the grace
	period and prune `$GIT_DIR/worktrees` immediately, or "never"
	may be used to suppress pruning.

gc.reflogExpire::
gc.<pattern>.reflogExpire::
	'git reflog expire' removes reflog entries older than
	this time; defaults to 90 days. The value "now" expires all
	entries immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration
	altogether. With "<pattern>" (e.g.
	"refs/stash") in the middle the setting applies only to
	the refs that match the <pattern>.

gc.reflogExpireUnreachable::
gc.<pattern>.reflogExpireUnreachable::
	'git reflog expire' removes reflog entries older than
	this time and are not reachable from the current tip;
	defaults to 30 days. The value "now" expires all entries
	immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration altogether.
	With "<pattern>" (e.g. "refs/stash")
	in the middle, the setting applies only to the refs that
	match the <pattern>.

gc.rerereResolved::
	Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are
	kept for this many days when 'git rerere gc' is run.
	You can also use more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc.
	The default is 60 days.  See linkgit:git-rerere[1].

gc.rerereUnresolved::
	Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
	kept for this many days when 'git rerere gc' is run.
	You can also use more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc.
	The default is 15 days.  See linkgit:git-rerere[1].

grep.lineNumber::
	If set to true, enable `-n` option by default.

grep.column::
	If set to true, enable the `--column` option by default.

grep.patternType::
	Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of 'basic', 'extended',
	'fixed', or 'perl' will enable the `--basic-regexp`, `--extended-regexp`,
	`--fixed-strings`, or `--perl-regexp` option accordingly, while the
	value 'default' will return to the default matching behavior.

grep.extendedRegexp::
	If set to true, enable `--extended-regexp` option by default. This
	option is ignored when the `grep.patternType` option is set to a value
	other than 'default'.

grep.threads::
	Number of grep worker threads to use.
	See `grep.threads` in linkgit:git-grep[1] for more information.

grep.fallbackToNoIndex::
	If set to true, fall back to git grep --no-index if git grep
	is executed outside of a git repository.  Defaults to false.

gpg.program::
	Use this custom program instead of "`gpg`" found on `$PATH` when
	making or verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the
	same command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached
	signature, "`gpg --verify $file - <$signature`" is run, and the
	program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with
	code 0, and to generate an ASCII-armored detached signature, the
	standard input of "`gpg -bsau $key`" is fed with the contents to be
	signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its
	standard output.

gpg.format::
	Specifies which key format to use when signing with `--gpg-sign`.
	Default is "openpgp" and another possible value is "x509".

gpg.<format>.program::
	Use this to customize the program used for the signing format you
	chose. (see `gpg.program` and `gpg.format`) `gpg.program` can still
	be used as a legacy synonym for	`gpg.openpgp.program`. The default
	value for `gpg.x509.program` is "gpgsm".

include::gui-config.txt[]

guitool.<name>.cmd::
	Specifies the shell command line to execute when the corresponding item
	of the linkgit:git-gui[1] `Tools` menu is invoked. This option is
	mandatory for every tool. The command is executed from the root of
	the working directory, and in the environment it receives the name of
	the tool as `GIT_GUITOOL`, the name of the currently selected file as
	'FILENAME', and the name of the current branch as 'CUR_BRANCH' (if
	the head is detached, 'CUR_BRANCH' is empty).

guitool.<name>.needsFile::
	Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees
	that 'FILENAME' is not empty.

guitool.<name>.noConsole::
	Run the command silently, without creating a window to display its
	output.

guitool.<name>.noRescan::
	Don't rescan the working directory for changes after the tool
	finishes execution.

guitool.<name>.confirm::
	Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.

guitool.<name>.argPrompt::
	Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool
	through the `ARGS` environment variable. Since requesting an
	argument implies confirmation, the 'confirm' option has no effect
	if this is enabled. If the option is set to 'true', 'yes', or '1',
	the dialog uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact
	value of the variable is used.

guitool.<name>.revPrompt::
	Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the
	`REVISION` environment variable. In other aspects this option
	is similar to 'argPrompt', and can be used together with it.

guitool.<name>.revUnmerged::
	Show only unmerged branches in the 'revPrompt' subdialog.
	This is useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not
	for things like checkout or reset.

guitool.<name>.title::
	Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The default
	is the tool name.

guitool.<name>.prompt::
	Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of
	the dialog, before subsections for 'argPrompt' and 'revPrompt'.
	The default value includes the actual command.

help.browser::
	Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the
	'web' format. See linkgit:git-help[1].

help.format::
	Override the default help format used by linkgit:git-help[1].
	Values 'man', 'info', 'web' and 'html' are supported. 'man' is
	the default. 'web' and 'html' are the same.

help.autoCorrect::
	Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after
	waiting for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec). If more
	than one command can be deduced from the entered text, nothing
	will be executed.  If the value of this option is negative,
	the corrected command will be executed immediately. If the
	value is 0 - the command will be just shown but not executed.
	This is the default.

help.htmlPath::
	Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File system paths
	and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed with this path when
	help is displayed in the 'web' format. This defaults to the documentation
	path of your Git installation.

http.proxy::
	Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the 'http_proxy',
	'https_proxy', and 'all_proxy' environment variables (see `curl(1)`). In
	addition to the syntax understood by curl, it is possible to specify a
	proxy string with a user name but no password, in which case git will
	attempt to acquire one in the same way it does for other credentials. See
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for more information. The syntax thus is
	'[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port]'. This can be overridden
	on a per-remote basis; see remote.<name>.proxy

http.proxyAuthMethod::
	Set the method with which to authenticate against the HTTP proxy. This
	only takes effect if the configured proxy string contains a user name part
	(i.e. is of the form 'user@host' or 'user@host:port'). This can be
	overridden on a per-remote basis; see `remote.<name>.proxyAuthMethod`.
	Both can be overridden by the `GIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD` environment
	variable.  Possible values are:
+
--
* `anyauth` - Automatically pick a suitable authentication method. It is
  assumed that the proxy answers an unauthenticated request with a 407
  status code and one or more Proxy-authenticate headers with supported
  authentication methods. This is the default.
* `basic` - HTTP Basic authentication
* `digest` - HTTP Digest authentication; this prevents the password from being
  transmitted to the proxy in clear text
* `negotiate` - GSS-Negotiate authentication (compare the --negotiate option
  of `curl(1)`)
* `ntlm` - NTLM authentication (compare the --ntlm option of `curl(1)`)
--

http.emptyAuth::
	Attempt authentication without seeking a username or password.  This
	can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without specifying
	a username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a username for
	authentication.

http.delegation::
	Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is disabled
	by default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set parameter to tell
	the server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user
	credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos. Possible values are:
+
--
* `none` - Don't allow any delegation.
* `policy` - Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in the
  Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter of realm policy.
* `always` - Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.
--


http.extraHeader::
	Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a server.  If
	more than one such entry exists, all of them are added as extra
	headers.  To allow overriding the settings inherited from the system
	config, an empty value will reset the extra headers to the empty list.

http.cookieFile::
	The pathname of a file containing previously stored cookie lines,
	which should be used
	in the Git http session, if they match the server. The file format
	of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or
	the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format (see `curl(1)`).
	NOTE that the file specified with http.cookieFile is used only as
	input unless http.saveCookies is set.

http.saveCookies::
	If set, store cookies received during requests to the file specified by
	http.cookieFile. Has no effect if http.cookieFile is unset.

http.sslVersion::
	The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if you
	want to force the default.  The available and default version
	depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the
	particular configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally
	this sets the 'CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION' option; see the libcurl
	documentation for more details on the format of this option and
	for the ssl version supported. Actually the possible values of
	this option are:

	- sslv2
	- sslv3
	- tlsv1
	- tlsv1.0
	- tlsv1.1
	- tlsv1.2
	- tlsv1.3

+
Can be overridden by the `GIT_SSL_VERSION` environment variable.
To force git to use libcurl's default ssl version and ignore any
explicit http.sslversion option, set `GIT_SSL_VERSION` to the
empty string.

http.sslCipherList::
  A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL connection.
  The available ciphers depend on whether libcurl was built against
  NSS or OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto
  library in use.  Internally this sets the 'CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST'
  option; see the libcurl documentation for more details on the format
  of this list.
+
Can be overridden by the `GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment variable.
To force git to use libcurl's default cipher list and ignore any
explicit http.sslCipherList option, set `GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` to the
empty string.

http.sslVerify::
	Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing
	over HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by the
	`GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` environment variable.

http.sslCert::
	File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing
	over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the `GIT_SSL_CERT` environment
	variable.

http.sslKey::
	File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing
	over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the `GIT_SSL_KEY` environment
	variable.

http.sslCertPasswordProtected::
	Enable Git's password prompt for the SSL certificate.  Otherwise
	OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the
	certificate or private key is encrypted.  Can be overridden by the
	`GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED` environment variable.

http.sslCAInfo::
	File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when
	fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
	`GIT_SSL_CAINFO` environment variable.

http.sslCAPath::
	Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer
	with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden
	by the `GIT_SSL_CAPATH` environment variable.

http.sslBackend::
	Name of the SSL backend to use (e.g. "openssl" or "schannel").
	This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for choosing the SSL
	backend at runtime.

http.schannelCheckRevoke::
	Used to enforce or disable certificate revocation checks in cURL
	when http.sslBackend is set to "schannel". Defaults to `true` if
	unset. Only necessary to disable this if Git consistently errors
	and the message is about checking the revocation status of a
	certificate. This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for
	setting the relevant SSL option at runtime.

http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo::
	As of cURL v7.60.0, the Secure Channel backend can use the
	certificate bundle provided via `http.sslCAInfo`, but that would
	override the Windows Certificate Store. Since this is not desirable
	by default, Git will tell cURL not to use that bundle by default
	when the `schannel` backend was configured via `http.sslBackend`,
	unless `http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo` overrides this behavior.

http.pinnedpubkey::
	Public key of the https service. It may either be the filename of
	a PEM or DER encoded public key file or a string starting with
	'sha256//' followed by the base64 encoded sha256 hash of the
	public key. See also libcurl 'CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY'. git will
	exit with an error if this option is set but not supported by
	cURL.

http.sslTry::
	Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers
	when connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed
	if the FTP server requires it for security reasons or you wish
	to connect securely whenever remote FTP server supports it.
	Default is false since it might trigger certificate verification
	errors on misconfigured servers.

http.maxRequests::
	How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be overridden
	by the `GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS` environment variable. Default is 5.

http.minSessions::
	The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be kept across
	requests. They will not be ended with curl_easy_cleanup() until
	http_cleanup() is invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this
	value will be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.

http.postBuffer::
	Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP
	transports when POSTing data to the remote system.
	For requests larger than this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating a
	massive pack file locally.  Default is 1 MiB, which is
	sufficient for most requests.

http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime::
	If the HTTP transfer speed is less than 'http.lowSpeedLimit'
	for longer than 'http.lowSpeedTime' seconds, the transfer is aborted.
	Can be overridden by the `GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT` and
	`GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME` environment variables.

http.noEPSV::
	A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl.
	This can helpful with some "poor" ftp servers which don't
	support EPSV mode. Can be overridden by the `GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV`
	environment variable. Default is false (curl will use EPSV).

http.userAgent::
	The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server.  The default
	value represents the version of the client Git such as git/1.7.1.
	This option allows you to override this value to a more common value
	such as Mozilla/4.0.  This may be necessary, for instance, if
	connecting through a firewall that restricts HTTP connections to a set
	of common USER_AGENT strings (but not including those like git/1.7.1).
	Can be overridden by the `GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT` environment variable.

http.followRedirects::
	Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to `true`, git
	will transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it
	encounters. If set to `false`, git will treat all redirects as
	errors. If set to `initial`, git will follow redirects only for
	the initial request to a remote, but not for subsequent
	follow-up HTTP requests. Since git uses the redirected URL as
	the base for the follow-up requests, this is generally
	sufficient. The default is `initial`.

http.<url>.*::
	Any of the http.* options above can be applied selectively to some URLs.
	For a config key to match a URL, each element of the config key is
	compared to that of the URL, in the following order:
+
--
. Scheme (e.g., `https` in `https://example.com/`). This field
  must match exactly between the config key and the URL.

. Host/domain name (e.g., `example.com` in `https://example.com/`).
  This field must match between the config key and the URL. It is
  possible to specify a `*` as part of the host name to match all subdomains
  at this level. `https://*.example.com/` for example would match
  `https://foo.example.com/`, but not `https://foo.bar.example.com/`.

. Port number (e.g., `8080` in `http://example.com:8080/`).
  This field must match exactly between the config key and the URL.
  Omitted port numbers are automatically converted to the correct
  default for the scheme before matching.

. Path (e.g., `repo.git` in `https://example.com/repo.git`). The
  path field of the config key must match the path field of the URL
  either exactly or as a prefix of slash-delimited path elements.  This means
  a config key with path `foo/` matches URL path `foo/bar`.  A prefix can only
  match on a slash (`/`) boundary.  Longer matches take precedence (so a config
  key with path `foo/bar` is a better match to URL path `foo/bar` than a config
  key with just path `foo/`).

. User name (e.g., `user` in `https://user@example.com/repo.git`). If
  the config key has a user name it must match the user name in the
  URL exactly. If the config key does not have a user name, that
  config key will match a URL with any user name (including none),
  but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user name.
--
+
The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that matches
a config key's path is preferred to one that matches its user name. For example,
if the URL is `https://user@example.com/foo/bar` a config key match of
`https://example.com/foo` will be preferred over a config key match of
`https://user@example.com`.
+
All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password part,
if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching purposes) so that
equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will match properly.
Environment variable settings always override any matches.  The URLs that are
matched against are those given directly to Git commands.  This means any URLs
visited as a result of a redirection do not participate in matching.

ssh.variant::
	By default, Git determines the command line arguments to use
	based on the basename of the configured SSH command (configured
	using the environment variable `GIT_SSH` or `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` or
	the config setting `core.sshCommand`). If the basename is
	unrecognized, Git will attempt to detect support of OpenSSH
	options by first invoking the configured SSH command with the
	`-G` (print configuration) option and will subsequently use
	OpenSSH options (if that is successful) or no options besides
	the host and remote command (if it fails).
+
The config variable `ssh.variant` can be set to override this detection.
Valid values are `ssh` (to use OpenSSH options), `plink`, `putty`,
`tortoiseplink`, `simple` (no options except the host and remote command).
The default auto-detection can be explicitly requested using the value
`auto`.  Any other value is treated as `ssh`.  This setting can also be
overridden via the environment variable `GIT_SSH_VARIANT`.
+
The current command-line parameters used for each variant are as
follows:
+
--

* `ssh` - [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-o option] [username@]host command

* `simple` - [username@]host command

* `plink` or `putty` - [-P port] [-4] [-6] [username@]host command

* `tortoiseplink` - [-P port] [-4] [-6] -batch [username@]host command

--
+
Except for the `simple` variant, command-line parameters are likely to
change as git gains new features.

i18n.commitEncoding::
	Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git itself
	does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
	importing commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history
	browser (and possibly at other places in the future or in other
	porcelains). See e.g. linkgit:git-mailinfo[1]. Defaults to 'utf-8'.

i18n.logOutputEncoding::
	Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when
	running 'git log' and friends.

imap::
	The configuration variables in the 'imap' section are described
	in linkgit:git-imap-send[1].

index.threads::
	Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the index.
	This is meant to reduce index load time on multiprocessor machines.
	Specifying 0 or 'true' will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
	CPU's and set the number of threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or
	'false' will disable multithreading. Defaults to 'true'.

index.version::
	Specify the version with which new index files should be
	initialized.  This does not affect existing repositories.

init.templateDir::
	Specify the directory from which templates will be copied.
	(See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of linkgit:git-init[1].)

instaweb.browser::
	Specify the program that will be used to browse your working
	repository in gitweb. See linkgit:git-instaweb[1].

instaweb.httpd::
	The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working
	repository. See linkgit:git-instaweb[1].

instaweb.local::
	If true the web server started by linkgit:git-instaweb[1] will
	be bound to the local IP (127.0.0.1).

instaweb.modulePath::
	The default module path for linkgit:git-instaweb[1] to use
	instead of /usr/lib/apache2/modules.  Only used if httpd
	is Apache.

instaweb.port::
	The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See
	linkgit:git-instaweb[1].

interactive.singleKey::
	In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter
	input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter).
	Currently this is used by the `--patch` mode of
	linkgit:git-add[1], linkgit:git-checkout[1], linkgit:git-commit[1],
	linkgit:git-reset[1], and linkgit:git-stash[1]. Note that this
	setting is silently ignored if portable keystroke input
	is not available; requires the Perl module Term::ReadKey.

interactive.diffFilter::
	When an interactive command (such as `git add --patch`) shows
	a colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell
	command defined by this configuration variable. The command may
	mark up the diff further for human consumption, provided that it
	retains a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the
	original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering).

log.abbrevCommit::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--abbrev-commit`. You may
	override this option with `--no-abbrev-commit`.

log.date::
	Set the default date-time mode for the 'log' command.
	Setting a value for log.date is similar to using 'git log''s
	`--date` option.  See linkgit:git-log[1] for details.

log.decorate::
	Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
	command. If 'short' is specified, the ref name prefixes 'refs/heads/',
	'refs/tags/' and 'refs/remotes/' will not be printed. If 'full' is
	specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed.
	If 'auto' is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal,
	the ref names are shown as if 'short' were given, otherwise no ref
	names are shown. This is the same as the `--decorate` option
	of the `git log`.

log.follow::
	If `true`, `git log` will act as if the `--follow` option was used when
	a single <path> is given.  This has the same limitations as `--follow`,
	i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
	on non-linear history.

log.graphColors::
	A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw
	history lines in `git log --graph`.

log.showRoot::
	If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event.
	This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree.
	Tools like linkgit:git-log[1] or linkgit:git-whatchanged[1], which
	normally hide the root commit will now show it. True by default.

log.showSignature::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--show-signature`.

log.mailmap::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-log[1], linkgit:git-show[1], and
	linkgit:git-whatchanged[1] assume `--use-mailmap`.

mailinfo.scissors::
	If true, makes linkgit:git-mailinfo[1] (and therefore
	linkgit:git-am[1]) act by default as if the --scissors option
	was provided on the command-line. When active, this features
	removes everything from the message body before a scissors
	line (i.e. consisting mainly of ">8", "8<" and "-").

mailmap.file::
	The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default
	mailmap, located in the root of the repository, is loaded
	first, then the mailmap file pointed to by this variable.
	The location of the mailmap file may be in a repository
	subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the repository itself.
	See linkgit:git-shortlog[1] and linkgit:git-blame[1].

mailmap.blob::
	Like `mailmap.file`, but consider the value as a reference to a
	blob in the repository. If both `mailmap.file` and
	`mailmap.blob` are given, both are parsed, with entries from
	`mailmap.file` taking precedence. In a bare repository, this
	defaults to `HEAD:.mailmap`. In a non-bare repository, it
	defaults to empty.

man.viewer::
	Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the
	'man' format. See linkgit:git-help[1].

man.<tool>.cmd::
	Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The
	specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page
	passed as argument. (See linkgit:git-help[1].)

man.<tool>.path::
	Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
	display help in the 'man' format. See linkgit:git-help[1].

include::merge-config.txt[]

mergetool.<tool>.path::
	Override the path for the given tool.  This is useful in case
	your tool is not in the PATH.

mergetool.<tool>.cmd::
	Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool.  The
	specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
	variables available: 'BASE' is the name of a temporary file
	containing the common base of the files to be merged, if available;
	'LOCAL' is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of
	the file on the current branch; 'REMOTE' is the name of a temporary
	file containing the contents of the file from the branch being
	merged; 'MERGED' contains the name of the file to which the merge
	tool should write the results of a successful merge.

mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode::
	For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of
	the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge was
	successful.  If this is not set to true then the merge target file
	timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been successful
	if the file has been updated, otherwise the user is prompted to
	indicate the success of the merge.

mergetool.meld.hasOutput::
	Older versions of `meld` do not support the `--output` option.
	Git will attempt to detect whether `meld` supports `--output`
	by inspecting the output of `meld --help`.  Configuring
	`mergetool.meld.hasOutput` will make Git skip these checks and
	use the configured value instead.  Setting `mergetool.meld.hasOutput`
	to `true` tells Git to unconditionally use the `--output` option,
	and `false` avoids using `--output`.

mergetool.keepBackup::
	After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers
	can be saved as a file with a `.orig` extension.  If this variable
	is set to `false` then this file is not preserved.  Defaults to
	`true` (i.e. keep the backup files).

mergetool.keepTemporaries::
	When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of temporary
	files to pass to the tool. If the tool returns an error and this
	variable is set to `true`, then these temporary files will be
	preserved, otherwise they will be removed after the tool has
	exited. Defaults to `false`.

mergetool.writeToTemp::
	Git writes temporary 'BASE', 'LOCAL', and 'REMOTE' versions of
	conflicting files in the worktree by default.  Git will attempt
	to use a temporary directory for these files when set `true`.
	Defaults to `false`.

mergetool.prompt::
	Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program.

notes.mergeStrategy::
	Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes
	conflicts.  Must be one of `manual`, `ours`, `theirs`, `union`, or
	`cat_sort_uniq`.  Defaults to `manual`.  See "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
	section of linkgit:git-notes[1] for more information on each strategy.

notes.<name>.mergeStrategy::
	Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into
	refs/notes/<name>.  This overrides the more general
	"notes.mergeStrategy".  See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section in
	linkgit:git-notes[1] for more information on the available strategies.

notes.displayRef::
	The (fully qualified) refname from which to show notes when
	showing commit messages.  The value of this variable can be set
	to a glob, in which case notes from all matching refs will be
	shown.  You may also specify this configuration variable
	several times.  A warning will be issued for refs that do not
	exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is silently
	ignored.
+
This setting can be overridden with the `GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF`
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.
+
The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden by
GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be
displayed.

notes.rewrite.<command>::
	When rewriting commits with <command> (currently `amend` or
	`rebase`) and this variable is set to `true`, Git
	automatically copies your notes from the original to the
	rewritten commit.  Defaults to `true`, but see
	"notes.rewriteRef" below.

notes.rewriteMode::
	When copying notes during a rewrite (see the
	"notes.rewrite.<command>" option), determines what to do if
	the target commit already has a note.  Must be one of
	`overwrite`, `concatenate`, `cat_sort_uniq`, or `ignore`.
	Defaults to `concatenate`.
+
This setting can be overridden with the `GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE`
environment variable.

notes.rewriteRef::
	When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
	qualified) ref whose notes should be copied.  The ref may be a
	glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied.
	You may also specify this configuration several times.
+
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
enable note rewriting.  Set it to `refs/notes/commits` to enable
rewriting for the default commit notes.
+
This setting can be overridden with the `GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF`
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or
globs.

pack.window::
	The size of the window used by linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] when no
	window size is given on the command line. Defaults to 10.

pack.depth::
	The maximum delta depth used by linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] when no
	maximum depth is given on the command line. Defaults to 50.
	Maximum value is 4095.

pack.windowMemory::
	The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each thread
	in linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] for pack window memory when
	no limit is given on the command line.  The value can be
	suffixed with "k", "m", or "g".  When left unconfigured (or
	set explicitly to 0), there will be no limit.

pack.compression::
	An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects
	in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
	compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being
	slowest.  If not set,  defaults to core.compression.  If that is
	not set,  defaults to -1, the zlib default, which is "a default
	compromise between speed and compression (currently equivalent
	to level 6)."
+
Note that changing the compression level will not automatically recompress
all existing objects. You can force recompression by passing the -F option
to linkgit:git-repack[1].

pack.island::
	An extended regular expression configuring a set of delta
	islands. See "DELTA ISLANDS" in linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]
	for details.

pack.islandCore::
	Specify an island name which gets to have its objects be
	packed first. This creates a kind of pseudo-pack at the front
	of one pack, so that the objects from the specified island are
	hopefully faster to copy into any pack that should be served
	to a user requesting these objects. In practice this means
	that the island specified should likely correspond to what is
	the most commonly cloned in the repo. See also "DELTA ISLANDS"
	in linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

pack.deltaCacheSize::
	The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] before writing them out to a pack.
	This cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not
	having to recompute the final delta result once the best match
	for all objects is found.  Repacking large repositories on machines
	which are tight with memory might be badly impacted by this though,
	especially if this cache pushes the system into swapping.
	A value of 0 means no limit. The smallest size of 1 byte may be
	used to virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.

pack.deltaCacheLimit::
	The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]. This cache is used to speed up the
	writing object phase by not having to recompute the final delta
	result once the best match for all objects is found.
	Defaults to 1000. Maximum value is 65535.

pack.threads::
	Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best
	delta matches.  This requires that linkgit:git-pack-objects[1]
	be compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a
	warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor
	machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search window
	is however multiplied by the number of threads.
	Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU's
	and set the number of threads accordingly.

pack.indexVersion::
	Specify the default pack index version.  Valid values are 1 for
	legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for
	the new pack index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB
	as well as proper protection against the repacking of corrupted
	packs.  Version 2 is the default.  Note that version 2 is enforced
	and this config option ignored whenever the corresponding pack is
	larger than 2 GB.
+
If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2 `*.idx` file,
cloning or fetching over a non native protocol (e.g. "http")
that will copy both `*.pack` file and corresponding `*.idx` file from the
other side may give you a repository that cannot be accessed with your
older version of Git. If the `*.pack` file is smaller than 2 GB, however,
you can use linkgit:git-index-pack[1] on the *.pack file to regenerate
the `*.idx` file.

pack.packSizeLimit::
	The maximum size of a pack.  This setting only affects
	packing to a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol
	is unaffected.  It can be overridden by the `--max-pack-size`
	option of linkgit:git-repack[1].  Reaching this limit results
	in the creation of multiple packfiles; which in turn prevents
	bitmaps from being created.
	The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB.
	The default is unlimited.
	Common unit suffixes of 'k', 'm', or 'g' are
	supported.

pack.useBitmaps::
	When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when packing
	to stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch). Defaults to
	true. You should not generally need to turn this off unless
	you are debugging pack bitmaps.

pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)::
	This is a deprecated synonym for `repack.writeBitmaps`.

pack.writeBitmapHashCache::
	When true, git will include a "hash cache" section in the bitmap
	index (if one is written). This cache can be used to feed git's
	delta heuristics, potentially leading to better deltas between
	bitmapped and non-bitmapped objects (e.g., when serving a fetch
	between an older, bitmapped pack and objects that have been
	pushed since the last gc). The downside is that it consumes 4
	bytes per object of disk space, and that JGit's bitmap
	implementation does not understand it, causing it to complain if
	Git and JGit are used on the same repository. Defaults to false.

pager.<cmd>::
	If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the
	output of a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty.
	Otherwise, turns on pagination for the subcommand using the
	pager specified by the value of `pager.<cmd>`.  If `--paginate`
	or `--no-pager` is specified on the command line, it takes
	precedence over this option.  To disable pagination for all
	commands, set `core.pager` or `GIT_PAGER` to `cat`.

pretty.<name>::
	Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in
	linkgit:git-log[1]. Any aliases defined here can be used just
	as the built-in pretty formats could. For example,
	running `git config pretty.changelog "format:* %H %s"`
	would cause the invocation `git log --pretty=changelog`
	to be equivalent to running `git log "--pretty=format:* %H %s"`.
	Note that an alias with the same name as a built-in format
	will be silently ignored.

protocol.allow::
	If set, provide a user defined default policy for all protocols which
	don't explicitly have a policy (`protocol.<name>.allow`).  By default,
	if unset, known-safe protocols (http, https, git, ssh, file) have a
	default policy of `always`, known-dangerous protocols (ext) have a
	default policy of `never`, and all other protocols have a default
	policy of `user`.  Supported policies:
+
--

* `always` - protocol is always able to be used.

* `never` - protocol is never able to be used.

* `user` - protocol is only able to be used when `GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER` is
  either unset or has a value of 1.  This policy should be used when you want a
  protocol to be directly usable by the user but don't want it used by commands which
  execute clone/fetch/push commands without user input, e.g. recursive
  submodule initialization.

--

protocol.<name>.allow::
	Set a policy to be used by protocol `<name>` with clone/fetch/push
	commands. See `protocol.allow` above for the available policies.
+
The protocol names currently used by git are:
+
--
  - `file`: any local file-based path (including `file://` URLs,
    or local paths)

  - `git`: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP
    connection (or proxy, if configured)

  - `ssh`: git over ssh (including `host:path` syntax,
    `ssh://`, etc).

  - `http`: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http".
    Note that this does _not_ include `https`; if you want to configure
    both, you must do so individually.

  - any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use
    `hg` to allow the `git-remote-hg` helper)
--

protocol.version::
	Experimental. If set, clients will attempt to communicate with a
	server using the specified protocol version.  If unset, no
	attempt will be made by the client to communicate using a
	particular protocol version, this results in protocol version 0
	being used.
	Supported versions:
+
--

* `0` - the original wire protocol.

* `1` - the original wire protocol with the addition of a version string
  in the initial response from the server.

* `2` - link:technical/protocol-v2.html[wire protocol version 2].

--

include::push-config.txt[]

include::rebase-config.txt[]

include::receive-config.txt[]

remote.pushDefault::
	The remote to push to by default.  Overrides
	`branch.<name>.remote` for all branches, and is overridden by
	`branch.<name>.pushRemote` for specific branches.

remote.<name>.url::
	The URL of a remote repository.  See linkgit:git-fetch[1] or
	linkgit:git-push[1].

remote.<name>.pushurl::
	The push URL of a remote repository.  See linkgit:git-push[1].

remote.<name>.proxy::
	For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the URL to
	the proxy to use for that remote.  Set to the empty string to
	disable proxying for that remote.

remote.<name>.proxyAuthMethod::
	For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the method to use for
	authenticating against the proxy in use (probably set in
	`remote.<name>.proxy`). See `http.proxyAuthMethod`.

remote.<name>.fetch::
	The default set of "refspec" for linkgit:git-fetch[1]. See
	linkgit:git-fetch[1].

remote.<name>.push::
	The default set of "refspec" for linkgit:git-push[1]. See
	linkgit:git-push[1].

remote.<name>.mirror::
	If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave
	as if the `--mirror` option was given on the command line.

remote.<name>.skipDefaultUpdate::
	If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
	using linkgit:git-fetch[1] or the `update` subcommand of
	linkgit:git-remote[1].

remote.<name>.skipFetchAll::
	If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
	using linkgit:git-fetch[1] or the `update` subcommand of
	linkgit:git-remote[1].

remote.<name>.receivepack::
	The default program to execute on the remote side when pushing.  See
	option --receive-pack of linkgit:git-push[1].

remote.<name>.uploadpack::
	The default program to execute on the remote side when fetching.  See
	option --upload-pack of linkgit:git-fetch-pack[1].

remote.<name>.tagOpt::
	Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag following when
	fetching from remote <name>. Setting it to --tags will fetch every
	tag from remote <name>, even if they are not reachable from remote
	branch heads. Passing these flags directly to linkgit:git-fetch[1] can
	override this setting. See options --tags and --no-tags of
	linkgit:git-fetch[1].

remote.<name>.vcs::
	Setting this to a value <vcs> will cause Git to interact with
	the remote with the git-remote-<vcs> helper.

remote.<name>.prune::
	When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
	remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the
	remote (as if the `--prune` option was given on the command line).
	Overrides `fetch.prune` settings, if any.

remote.<name>.pruneTags::
	When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
	remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if pruning
	is activated in general via `remote.<name>.prune`, `fetch.prune` or
	`--prune`. Overrides `fetch.pruneTags` settings, if any.
+
See also `remote.<name>.prune` and the PRUNING section of
linkgit:git-fetch[1].

remotes.<group>::
	The list of remotes which are fetched by "git remote update
	<group>".  See linkgit:git-remote[1].

repack.useDeltaBaseOffset::
	By default, linkgit:git-repack[1] creates packs that use
	delta-base offset. If you need to share your repository with
	Git older than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb
	protocol such as http, then you need to set this option to
	"false" and repack. Access from old Git versions over the
	native protocol are unaffected by this option.

repack.packKeptObjects::
	If set to true, makes `git repack` act as if
	`--pack-kept-objects` was passed. See linkgit:git-repack[1] for
	details. Defaults to `false` normally, but `true` if a bitmap
	index is being written (either via `--write-bitmap-index` or
	`repack.writeBitmaps`).

repack.useDeltaIslands::
	If set to true, makes `git repack` act as if `--delta-islands`
	was passed. Defaults to `false`.

repack.writeBitmaps::
	When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all
	objects to disk (e.g., when `git repack -a` is run).  This
	index can speed up the "counting objects" phase of subsequent
	packs created for clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk
	space and extra time spent on the initial repack.  This has
	no effect if multiple packfiles are created.
	Defaults to false.

rerere.autoUpdate::
	When set to true, `git-rerere` updates the index with the
	resulting contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using
	previously recorded resolution.  Defaults to false.

rerere.enabled::
	Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical
	conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
	encountered again.  By default, linkgit:git-rerere[1] is
	enabled if there is an `rr-cache` directory under the
	`$GIT_DIR`, e.g. if "rerere" was previously used in the
	repository.

reset.quiet::
	When set to true, 'git reset' will default to the '--quiet' option.

include::sendemail-config.txt[]

sequence.editor::
	Text editor used by `git rebase -i` for editing the rebase instruction file.
	The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell when it is used.
	It can be overridden by the `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` environment variable.
	When not configured the default commit message editor is used instead.

showBranch.default::
	The default set of branches for linkgit:git-show-branch[1].
	See linkgit:git-show-branch[1].

splitIndex.maxPercentChange::
	When the split index feature is used, this specifies the
	percent of entries the split index can contain compared to the
	total number of entries in both the split index and the shared
	index before a new shared index is written.
	The value should be between 0 and 100. If the value is 0 then
	a new shared index is always written, if it is 100 a new
	shared index is never written.
	By default the value is 20, so a new shared index is written
	if the number of entries in the split index would be greater
	than 20 percent of the total number of entries.
	See linkgit:git-update-index[1].

splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire::
	When the split index feature is used, shared index files that
	were not modified since the time this variable specifies will
	be removed when a new shared index file is created. The value
	"now" expires all entries immediately, and "never" suppresses
	expiration altogether.
	The default value is "2.weeks.ago".
	Note that a shared index file is considered modified (for the
	purpose of expiration) each time a new split-index file is
	either created based on it or read from it.
	See linkgit:git-update-index[1].

status.relativePaths::
	By default, linkgit:git-status[1] shows paths relative to the
	current directory. Setting this variable to `false` shows paths
	relative to the repository root (this was the default for Git
	prior to v1.5.4).

status.short::
	Set to true to enable --short by default in linkgit:git-status[1].
	The option --no-short takes precedence over this variable.

status.branch::
	Set to true to enable --branch by default in linkgit:git-status[1].
	The option --no-branch takes precedence over this variable.

status.displayCommentPrefix::
	If set to true, linkgit:git-status[1] will insert a comment
	prefix before each output line (starting with
	`core.commentChar`, i.e. `#` by default). This was the
	behavior of linkgit:git-status[1] in Git 1.8.4 and previous.
	Defaults to false.

status.renameLimit::
	The number of files to consider when performing rename detection
	in linkgit:git-status[1] and linkgit:git-commit[1]. Defaults to
	the value of diff.renameLimit.

status.renames::
	Whether and how Git detects renames in linkgit:git-status[1] and
	linkgit:git-commit[1] .  If set to "false", rename detection is
	disabled. If set to "true", basic rename detection is enabled.
	If set to "copies" or "copy", Git will detect copies, as well.
	Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

status.showStash::
	If set to true, linkgit:git-status[1] will display the number of
	entries currently stashed away.
	Defaults to false.

status.showUntrackedFiles::
	By default, linkgit:git-status[1] and linkgit:git-commit[1] show
	files which are not currently tracked by Git. Directories which
	contain only untracked files, are shown with the directory name
	only. Showing untracked files means that Git needs to lstat() all
	the files in the whole repository, which might be slow on some
	systems. So, this variable controls how the commands displays
	the untracked files. Possible values are:
+
--
* `no` - Show no untracked files.
* `normal` - Show untracked files and directories.
* `all` - Show also individual files in untracked directories.
--
+
If this variable is not specified, it defaults to 'normal'.
This variable can be overridden with the -u|--untracked-files option
of linkgit:git-status[1] and linkgit:git-commit[1].

status.submoduleSummary::
	Defaults to false.
	If this is set to a non zero number or true (identical to -1 or an
	unlimited number), the submodule summary will be enabled and a
	summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown (see
	--summary-limit option of linkgit:git-submodule[1]). Please note
	that the summary output command will be suppressed for all
	submodules when `diff.ignoreSubmodules` is set to 'all' or only
	for those submodules where `submodule.<name>.ignore=all`. The only
	exception to that rule is that status and commit will show staged
	submodule changes. To
	also view the summary for ignored submodules you can either use
	the --ignore-submodules=dirty command-line option or the 'git
	submodule summary' command, which shows a similar output but does
	not honor these settings.

stash.showPatch::
	If this is set to true, the `git stash show` command without an
	option will show the stash entry in patch form.  Defaults to false.
	See description of 'show' command in linkgit:git-stash[1].

stash.showStat::
	If this is set to true, the `git stash show` command without an
	option will show diffstat of the stash entry.  Defaults to true.
	See description of 'show' command in linkgit:git-stash[1].

include::submodule-config.txt[]

tag.forceSignAnnotated::
	A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be GPG signed.
	If `--annotate` is specified on the command line, it takes
	precedence over this option.

tag.sort::
	This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when displayed by
	linkgit:git-tag[1]. Without the "--sort=<value>" option provided, the
	value of this variable will be used as the default.

tar.umask::
	This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of
	tar archive entries.  The default is 0002, which turns off the
	world write bit.  The special value "user" indicates that the
	archiving user's umask will be used instead.  See umask(2) and
	linkgit:git-archive[1].

transfer.fsckObjects::
	When `fetch.fsckObjects` or `receive.fsckObjects` are
	not set, the value of this variable is used instead.
	Defaults to false.
+
When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a malformed
object or a link to a nonexistent object. In addition, various other
issues are checked for, including legacy issues (see `fsck.<msg-id>`),
and potential security issues like the existence of a `.GIT` directory
or a malicious `.gitmodules` file (see the release notes for v2.2.1
and v2.17.1 for details). Other sanity and security checks may be
added in future releases.
+
On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those objects
unreachable, see "QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT" in
linkgit:git-receive-pack[1]. On the fetch side, malformed objects will
instead be left unreferenced in the repository.
+
Due to the non-quarantine nature of the `fetch.fsckObjects`
implementation it can not be relied upon to leave the object store
clean like `receive.fsckObjects` can.
+
As objects are unpacked they're written to the object store, so there
can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even though the
"fetch" failed, only to have a subsequent "fetch" succeed because only
new incoming objects are checked, not those that have already been
written to the object store. That difference in behavior should not be
relied upon. In the future, such objects may be quarantined for
"fetch" as well.
+
For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the quarantine
environment if they'd like the same protection as "push". E.g. in the
case of an internal mirror do the mirroring in two steps, one to fetch
the untrusted objects, and then do a second "push" (which will use the
quarantine) to another internal repo, and have internal clients
consume this pushed-to repository, or embargo internal fetches and
only allow them once a full "fsck" has run (and no new fetches have
happened in the meantime).

transfer.hideRefs::
	String(s) `receive-pack` and `upload-pack` use to decide which
	refs to omit from their initial advertisements.  Use more than
	one definition to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that is
	under the hierarchies listed in the value of this variable is
	excluded, and is hidden when responding to `git push` or `git
	fetch`.  See `receive.hideRefs` and `uploadpack.hideRefs` for
	program-specific versions of this config.
+
You may also include a `!` in front of the ref name to negate the entry,
explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry marked it as hidden.
If you have multiple hideRefs values, later entries override earlier ones
(and entries in more-specific config files override less-specific ones).
+
If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped from each
reference before it is matched against `transfer.hiderefs` patterns.
For example, if `refs/heads/master` is specified in `transfer.hideRefs` and
the current namespace is `foo`, then `refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master`
is omitted from the advertisements but `refs/heads/master` and
`refs/namespaces/bar/refs/heads/master` are still advertised as so-called
"have" lines. In order to match refs before stripping, add a `^` in front of
the ref name. If you combine `!` and `^`, `!` must be specified first.
+
Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the target
objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY" section of the
linkgit:gitnamespaces[7] man page; it's best to keep private data in a
separate repository.

transfer.unpackLimit::
	When `fetch.unpackLimit` or `receive.unpackLimit` are
	not set, the value of this variable is used instead.
	The default value is 100.

uploadarchive.allowUnreachable::
	If true, allow clients to use `git archive --remote` to request
	any tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the
	discussion in the "SECURITY" section of
	linkgit:git-upload-archive[1] for more details. Defaults to
	`false`.

uploadpack.hideRefs::
	This variable is the same as `transfer.hideRefs`, but applies
	only to `upload-pack` (and so affects only fetches, not pushes).
	An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by `git fetch` will fail.  See
	also `uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant`.

uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant::
	When `uploadpack.hideRefs` is in effect, allow `upload-pack`
	to accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the tip
	of a hidden ref (by default, such a request is rejected).
	See also `uploadpack.hideRefs`.  Even if this is false, a client
	may be able to steal objects via the techniques described in the
	"SECURITY" section of the linkgit:gitnamespaces[7] man page; it's
	best to keep private data in a separate repository.

uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant::
	Allow `upload-pack` to accept a fetch request that asks for an
	object that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that
	calculating object reachability is computationally expensive.
	Defaults to `false`.  Even if this is false, a client may be able
	to steal objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
	section of the linkgit:gitnamespaces[7] man page; it's best to
	keep private data in a separate repository.

uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant::
	Allow `upload-pack` to accept a fetch request that asks for any
	object at all.
	Defaults to `false`.

uploadpack.keepAlive::
	When `upload-pack` has started `pack-objects`, there may be a
	quiet period while `pack-objects` prepares the pack. Normally
	it would output progress information, but if `--quiet` was used
	for the fetch, `pack-objects` will output nothing at all until
	the pack data begins. Some clients and networks may consider
	the server to be hung and give up. Setting this option instructs
	`upload-pack` to send an empty keepalive packet every
	`uploadpack.keepAlive` seconds. Setting this option to 0
	disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5 seconds.

uploadpack.packObjectsHook::
	If this option is set, when `upload-pack` would run
	`git pack-objects` to create a packfile for a client, it will
	run this shell command instead.  The `pack-objects` command and
	arguments it _would_ have run (including the `git pack-objects`
	at the beginning) are appended to the shell command. The stdin
	and stdout of the hook are treated as if `pack-objects` itself
	was run. I.e., `upload-pack` will feed input intended for
	`pack-objects` to the hook, and expects a completed packfile on
	stdout.
+
Note that this configuration variable is ignored if it is seen in the
repository-level config (this is a safety measure against fetching from
untrusted repositories).

uploadpack.allowFilter::
	If this option is set, `upload-pack` will support partial
	clone and partial fetch object filtering.

uploadpack.allowRefInWant::
	If this option is set, `upload-pack` will support the `ref-in-want`
	feature of the protocol version 2 `fetch` command.  This feature
	is intended for the benefit of load-balanced servers which may
	not have the same view of what OIDs their refs point to due to
	replication delay.

url.<base>.insteadOf::
	Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to
	start, instead, with <base>. In cases where some site serves a
	large number of repositories, and serves them with multiple
	access methods, and some users need to use different access
	methods, this feature allows people to specify any of the
	equivalent URLs and have Git automatically rewrite the URL to
	the best alternative for the particular user, even for a
	never-before-seen repository on the site.  When more than one
	insteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is used.
+
Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the rewritten
URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom protocol or remote
helper, you may need to adjust the `protocol.*.allow` config to permit
the request.  In particular, protocols you expect to use for submodules
must be set to `always` rather than the default of `user`. See the
description of `protocol.allow` above.

url.<base>.pushInsteadOf::
	Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to;
	instead, it will be rewritten to start with <base>, and the
	resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves
	a large number of repositories, and serves them with multiple
	access methods, some of which do not allow push, this feature
	allows people to specify a pull-only URL and have Git
	automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a
	never-before-seen repository on the site.  When more than one
	pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is
	used.  If a remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this
	setting for that remote.

user.email::
	Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits.
	Can be overridden by the `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`, and
	`EMAIL` environment variables.  See linkgit:git-commit-tree[1].

user.name::
	Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits.
	Can be overridden by the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
	environment variables.  See linkgit:git-commit-tree[1].

user.useConfigOnly::
	Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for `user.email`
	and `user.name`, and instead retrieve the values only from the
	configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses
	and would like to use a different one for each repository, then
	with this configuration option set to `true` in the global config
	along with a name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before
	making new commits in a newly cloned repository.
	Defaults to `false`.

user.signingKey::
	If linkgit:git-tag[1] or linkgit:git-commit[1] is not selecting the
	key you want it to automatically when creating a signed tag or
	commit, you can override the default selection with this variable.
	This option is passed unchanged to gpg's --local-user parameter,
	so you may specify a key using any method that gpg supports.

versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)::
	Deprecated alias for `versionsort.suffix`.  Ignored if
	`versionsort.suffix` is set.

versionsort.suffix::
	Even when version sort is used in linkgit:git-tag[1], tagnames
	with the same base version but different suffixes are still sorted
	lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing
	after the main release (e.g. "1.0-rc1" after "1.0").  This
	variable can be specified to determine the sorting order of tags
	with different suffixes.
+
By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname containing
that suffix will appear before the corresponding main release.  E.g. if
the variable is set to "-rc", then all "1.0-rcX" tags will appear before
"1.0".  If specified multiple times, once per suffix, then the order of
suffixes in the configuration will determine the sorting order of tagnames
with those suffixes.  E.g. if "-pre" appears before "-rc" in the
configuration, then all "1.0-preX" tags will be listed before any
"1.0-rcX" tags.  The placement of the main release tag relative to tags
with various suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix
among those other suffixes.  E.g. if the suffixes "-rc", "", "-ck" and
"-bfs" appear in the configuration in this order, then all "v4.8-rcX" tags
are listed first, followed by "v4.8", then "v4.8-ckX" and finally
"v4.8-bfsX".
+
If more than one suffixes match the same tagname, then that tagname will
be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest position in
the tagname.  If more than one different matching suffixes start at
that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted according to the
longest of those suffixes.
The sorting order between different suffixes is undefined if they are
in multiple config files.

web.browser::
	Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands.
	Currently only linkgit:git-instaweb[1] and linkgit:git-help[1]
	may use it.

worktree.guessRemote::
	With `add`, if no branch argument, and neither of `-b` nor
	`-B` nor `--detach` are given, the command defaults to
	creating a new branch from HEAD.  If `worktree.guessRemote` is
	set to true, `worktree add` tries to find a remote-tracking
	branch whose name uniquely matches the new branch name.  If
	such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as "upstream"
	for the new branch.  If no such match can be found, it falls
	back to creating a new branch from the current HEAD.
