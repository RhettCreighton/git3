reftable.blockSize::
	The size in bytes used by the reftable backend when writing blocks.
	The block size is determined by the writer, and does not have to be a
	power of 2. The block size must be larger than the longest reference
	name or log entry used in the repository, as references cannot span
	blocks.
+
Powers of two that are friendly to the virtual memory system or
filesystem (such as 4kB or 8kB) are recommended. Larger sizes (64kB) can
yield better compression, with a possible increased cost incurred by
readers during access.
+
The largest block size is `16777215` bytes (15.99 MiB). The default value is
`4096` bytes (4kB). A value of `0` will use the default value.
