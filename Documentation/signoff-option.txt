--signoff::
--no-signoff::
	Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit
	log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project,
	but it typically certifies that committer has
	the rights to submit this work under the same license and
	agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
	(see http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).

The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff
option on the command line.
