Git 2.12 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes.

 * Use of an empty string that is used for 'everything matches' is
   still warned and Git asks users to use a more explicit '.' for that
   instead.  The hope is that existing users will not mind this
   change, and eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error,
   upgrading the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.  That
   is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming release (yet).

 * The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
   has been deprecated for quite some time, and will be removed in the
   upcoming release.

Fixes since v2.10
-----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.9 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * We often decide if a session is interactive by checking if the
   standard I/O streams are connected to a TTY, but isatty() that
   comes with Windows incorrectly returned true if it is used on NUL
   (i.e. an equivalent to /dev/null).  This has been fixed.
   (merge cbb3f3c9b1 js/mingw-isatty later to maint).

 * "git svn" did not work well with path components that are "0", and
   some configuration variable it uses were not documented.
   (merge ea9a93dcc2 ew/svn-fixes later to maint).

 * "git rev-parse --symbolic" failed with a more recent notation like
   "HEAD^-1" and "HEAD^!".
   (merge a2e7b04c44 jk/rev-parse-symbolic-parents-fix later to maint).

 * An empty directory in a working tree that can simply be nuked used
   to interfere while merging or cherry-picking a change to create a
   submodule directory there, which has been fixed..
   (merge 5423d2e700 dt/empty-submodule-in-merge later to maint).

 * The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
   superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
   out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
   project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
   number of refs.
   (merge 250ab24ab3 hv/submodule-not-yet-pushed-fix later to maint).

 * "git push --dry-run --recurse-submodule=on-demand" wasn't
   "--dry-run" in the submodules.
   (merge 0301c821c5 bw/push-dry-run later to maint).

 * The output from "git worktree list" was made in readdir() order,
   and was unstable.
   (merge 4df1d4d466 nd/worktree-list-fixup later to maint).

 * mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode configuration variable did not apply
   to built-in tools, but now it does.
   (merge 2967284456 da/mergetool-trust-exit-code later to maint).

 * "git p4" LFS support was broken when LFS stores an empty blob.
   (merge d5eb3cf5e7 ls/p4-empty-file-on-lfs later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
   (merge fa6ca11105 nd/qsort-in-merge-recursive later to maint).
   (merge fa3142c919 ak/lazy-prereq-mktemp later to maint).
