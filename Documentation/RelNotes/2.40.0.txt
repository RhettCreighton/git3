Git v2.40 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "merge-tree" learns a new `--merge-base` option.

 * "git jump" (in contrib/) learned to present the "quickfix list" to
   its standard output (instead of letting it consumed by the editor
   it invokes), and learned to also drive emacs/emacsclient.

 * "git var UNKNOWN_VARIABLE" and "git var VARIABLE" with the variable
   given an empty value used to behave identically.  Now the latter
   just gives an empty output, while the former still gives an error
   message.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * `git bisect` becomes a builtin.

 * The pack-bitmap machinery is taught to log the paths of redundant
   bitmap(s) to trace2 instead of stderr.



Fixes since v2.39
-----------------

 * Various leak fixes.
   (merge ac95f5d36a ab/various-leak-fixes later to maint).

 * Fix a bug where `pack-objects` would not respect multiple `--filter`
   arguments when invoked directly.
   (merge d4f7036887 rs/multi-filter-args later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
