Git 2.14 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes.

 * Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
   'everything matches' is still warned and Git asks users to use a
   more explicit '.' for that instead.  The hope is that existing
   users will not mind this change, and eventually the warning can be
   turned into a hard error, upgrading the deprecation into removal of
   this (mis)feature.  That is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming
   release (yet).

 * Git now avoids blindly falling back to ".git" when the setup
   sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.  A corner case that
   happens to work right now may be broken by a call to die("BUG").
   We've tried hard to locate such cases and fixed them, but there
   might still be cases that need to be addressed--bug reports are
   greatly appreciated.


Updates since v2.13
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * The colors in which "git status --short --branch" showed the names
   of the current branch and its remote-tracking branch are now
   configurable.

 * "git clone" learned the "--no-tags" option not to fetch all tags
   initially, and also set up the tagopt not to follow any tags in
   subsequent fetches.

 * "git archive --format=zip" learned to use zip64 extension when
   necessary to go beyond the 4GB limit.
   (merge 867e40ff3a rs/large-zip later to maint).

 * "git reset" learned "--recurse-submodules" option.

 * "git diff --submodule=diff" now recurses into nested submodules.
   (merge 5a5221427c jk/diff-submodule-diff-inline later to maint).

 * "git repack" learned to accept the --threads=<n> option and pass it
   to pack-objects.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The default packed-git limit value has been raised on larger
   platforms to save "git fetch" from a (recoverable) failure while
   "gc" is running in parallel.

 * Code to update the cache-tree has been tightened so that we won't
   accidentally write out any 0{40} entry in the tree object.
   (merge a96d3cc3f6 jk/no-null-sha1-in-cache-tree later to maint).

 * Attempt to allow us notice "fishy" situation where we fail to
   remove the temporary directory used during the test.

 * Travis CI gained a task to format the documentation with both
   AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor.
   (merge 505ad91304 ls/travis-doc-asciidoctor later to maint).

 * Some platforms have ulong that is smaller than time_t, and our
   historical use of ulong for timestamp would mean they cannot
   represent some timestamp that the platform allows.  Invent a
   separate and dedicated timestamp_t (so that we can distingiuish
   timestamps and a vanilla ulongs, which along is already a good
   move), and then declare uintmax_t is the type to be used as the
   timestamp_t.

 * We can trigger Windows auto-build tester (credits: Dscho &
   Microsoft) from our existing Travis CI tester now.

 * Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.



Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.13
-----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.13 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git gc" did not interact well with "git worktree"-managed
   per-worktree refs.

 * "git cherry-pick" and other uses of the sequencer machinery
   mishandled a trailer block whose last line is an incomplete line.
   This has been fixed so that an additional sign-off etc. are added
   after completing the existing incomplete line.
   (merge 44dc738a39 jt/use-trailer-api-in-commands later to maint).

 * The codepath in "git am" that is used when running "git rebase"
   leaked memory held for the log message of the commits being rebased.
   (merge 721f5f1e35 jk/am-leakfix later to maint).

 * "git clone --config var=val" is a way to populate the
   per-repository configuration file of the new repository, but it did
   not work well when val is an empty string.  This has been fixed.
   (merge db4eca1fea jn/clone-add-empty-config-from-command-line later to maint).

 * Setting "log.decorate=false" in the configuration file did not take
   effect in v2.13, which has been corrected.
   (merge c74271aae7 ah/log-decorate-default-to-auto later to maint).

 * A few codepaths in "checkout" and "am" working on an unborn branch
   tried to access an uninitialized piece of memory.
   (merge 57e0ef0e0e rs/checkout-am-fix-unborn later to maint).

 * The Web interface to gmane news archive is long gone, even though
   the articles are still accessible via NTTP.  Replace the links with
   ones to public-inbox.org.  Because their message identification is
   based on the actual message-id, it is likely that it will be easier
   to migrate away from it if/when necessary.
   (merge 5840eb9d14 ab/doc-replace-gmane-links later to maint).

 * The receive-pack program now makes sure that the push certificate
   records the same set of push options used for pushing.
   (merge cbaf82cc6b jt/push-options-doc later to maint).

 * Tests have been updated to pass under GETTEXT_POISON (a mechanism
   to ensure that output strings that should not be translated are
   not translated by mistake), and TravisCI is told to run them.
   (merge b8e188f6f5 ab/fix-poison-tests later to maint).

 * "git checkout --recurse-submodules" did not quite work with a
   submodule that itself has submodules.
   (merge 218c883783 sb/checkout-recurse-submodules later to maint).

 * Plug some leaks and updates internal API used to implement the
   split index feature to make it easier to avoid such a leak in the
   future.
   (merge de950c5773 nd/split-index-unshare later to maint).

 * "pack-objects" can stream a slice of an existing packfile out when
   the pack bitmap can tell that the reachable objects are all needed
   in the output, without inspecting individual objects.  This
   strategy however would not work well when "--local" and other
   options are in use, and need to be disabled.
   (merge da5a1f8100 jk/disable-pack-reuse-when-broken later to maint).

 * Fix memory leaks pointed out by Coverity (and people).
   (merge 443a12f37b js/plug-leaks later to maint).

 * "git read-tree -m" (no tree-ish) gave a nonsense suggestion "use
   --empty if you want to clear the index".  With "-m", such a request
   will still fail anyway, as you'd need to name at least one tree-ish
   to be merged.
   (merge b9b10d3681 jc/read-tree-empty-with-m later to maint).

 * Make sure our tests would pass when the sources are checked out
   with "platform native" line ending convention by default on
   Windows.  Some "text" files out tests use and the test scripts
   themselves that are meant to be run with /bin/sh, ought to be
   checked out with eol=LF even on Windows.
   (merge 2779f66505 js/eol-on-ourselves later to maint).

 * Introduce the BUG() macro to improve die("BUG: ...").
   (merge 3d7dd2d3b6 jk/bug-to-abort later to maint).

 * Clarify documentation for include.path and includeIf.<condition>.path
   configuration variables.
   (merge ce933ebd5a jk/doc-config-include later to maint).

 * Git sometimes gives an advice in a rhetorical question that does
   not require an answer, which can confuse new users and non native
   speakers.  Attempt to rephrase them.
   (merge 6963893943 ja/do-not-ask-needless-questions later to maint).

 * A few http:// links that are redirected to https:// in the
   documentation have been updated to https:// links.
   (merge 5e68729fd9 jk/update-links-in-docs later to maint).

 * "git for-each-ref --format=..." with %(HEAD) in the format used to
   resolve the HEAD symref as many times as it had processed refs,
   which was wasteful, and "git branch" shared the same problem.
   (merge 613a0e52ea kn/ref-filter-branch-list later to maint).

 * Regression fix to topic recently merged to 'master'.
   (merge d096d7f1ef pw/rebase-i-regression-fix later to maint).

 * The shell completion script (in contrib/) learned "git stash" has
   a new "push" subcommand.
   (merge 3851e4483f tg/stash-push-fixup later to maint).

 * "git interpret-trailers", when used as GIT_EDITOR for "git commit
   -v", looked for and appended to a trailer block at the very end,
   i.e. at the end of the "diff" output.  The command has been
   corrected to pay attention to the cut-mark line "commit -v" adds to
   the buffer---the real trailer block should appear just before it.
   (merge d76650b8d1 bm/interpret-trailers-cut-line-is-eom later to maint).

 * A test allowed both "git push" and "git receive-pack" on the other
   end write their traces into the same file.  This is OK on platforms
   that allows atomically appending to a file opened with O_APPEND,
   but on other platforms led to a mangled output, causing
   intermittent test failures.  This has been fixed by disabling
   traces from "receive-pack" in the test.
   (merge 71406ed4d6 jk/alternate-ref-optim later to maint).

 * Tag objects, which are not reachable from any ref, that point at
   missing objects were mishandled by "git gc" and friends (they
   should silently be ignored instead)
   (merge a3ba6bf10a jk/ignore-broken-tags-when-ignoring-missing-links later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
   (merge 515360f9e9 jn/credential-doc-on-clear later to maint).
   (merge 0e6d899fee ab/aix-needs-compat-regex later to maint).
   (merge e294e8959f jc/apply-fix-mismerge later to maint).
   (merge 7f1b225153 bw/submodule-with-bs-path later to maint).
   (merge c8f7c8b704 tb/dedup-crlf-tests later to maint).
   (merge 449456ad47 sg/core-filemode-doc-typofix later to maint).
   (merge ba4dce784e km/log-showsignature-doc later to maint).
