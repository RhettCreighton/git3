Fixes since v2.34
-----------------

 * "git grep" looking in a blob that has non-UTF8 payload was
   completely broken when linked with certain versions of PCREv2
   library in the latest release.

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge edbd9f3715 ab/update-submitting-patches later to maint).

 * "git pull" with any strategy when the other side is behind us
   should succeed as it is a no-op, but doesn't.
   (merge ea1954af ev/pull-already-up-to-date-is-noop later to maint).

 * An earlier change in 2.34.0 caused JGit application (that abused
   GIT_EDITOR mechanism when invoking "git config") to get stuck with
   a SIGTTOU signal; it has been reverted.
   (merge e3f7e01b50 jc/save-restore-terminal-revert later to maint).

 * An earlier change that broke .gitignore matching has been reverted.
   (merge 33c5d6c845 ds/add-rm-with-sparse-index later to maint).
