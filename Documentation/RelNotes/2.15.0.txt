Git 2.15 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes and other notable changes.

 * Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
   'everything matches' is still warned and Git asks users to use a
   more explicit '.' for that instead.  The hope is that existing
   users will not mind this change, and eventually the warning can be
   turned into a hard error, upgrading the deprecation into removal of
   this (mis)feature.  That is now scheduled to happen in the upcoming
   release.

 * Git now avoids blindly falling back to ".git" when the setup
   sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.  A corner case that
   happens to work right now may be broken by a call to die("BUG").
   We've tried hard to locate such cases and fixed them, but there
   might still be cases that need to be addressed--bug reports are
   greatly appreciated.


Updates since v2.14
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * An example that is now obsolete has been removed from a sample hook,
   and an old example in it that added a sign-off manually has been
   improved to use the interpret-trailers command.

 * The advice message given when "git rebase" stops for conflicting
   changes has been improved.

 * The "rerere-train" script (in contrib/) learned the "--overwrite"
   option to allow overwriting existing recorded resolutions.
   (merge ad53bf79aa rg/rerere-train-overwrite later to maint).

 * "git contacts" (in contrib/) now lists the address on the
   "Reported-by:" trailer to its output, in addition to those on
   S-o-b: and other trailers, to make it easier to notify (and thank)
   the original bug reporter.
   (merge 09ac673788 eb/contacts-reported-by later to maint).

 * "git rebase", especially when it is run by mistake and ends up
   trying to replay many changes, spent long time in silence.  The
   command has been taught to show progress report when it spends
   long time preparing these many changes to replay (which would give
   the user a chance to abort with ^C).


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.

 * Start using selected c99 constructs in small, stable and
   essentialpart of the system to catch people who care about
   older compilers that do not grok them.

 * The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
   latency give a "delayed" response.

 * Many uses of comparision callback function the hashmap API uses
   cast the callback function type when registering it to
   hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
   the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
   The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
   pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.

 * Because recent Git for Windows do come with a real msgfmt, the
   build procedure for git-gui has been updated to use it instead of a
   hand-rolled substitute.
   (merge 90dbf226ba js/git-gui-msgfmt-on-windows later to maint).

 * "git grep --recurse-submodules" has been reworked to give a more
   consistent output across submodule boundary (and do its thing
   without having to fork a separate process).

 * A helper function to read a single whole line into strbuf
   mistakenly triggered OOM error at EOF under certain conditions,
   which has been fixed.
   (merge 642956cf45 rs/strbuf-getwholeline-fix later to maint).

 * The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.

 * "git commit" used to discard the index and re-read from the filesystem
   just in case the pre-commit hook has updated it in the middle; this
   has been optimized out when we know we do not run the pre-commit hook.
   (merge 680ee550d7 kw/commit-keep-index-when-pre-commit-is-not-run later to maint).


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.14
-----------------

 * "%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
   color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
   honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
   of the output medium.
   (merge 11b087adfd jk/ref-filter-colors later to maint).

 * The http.{sslkey,sslCert} configuration variables are to be
   interpreted as a pathname that honors "~[username]/" prefix, but
   weren't, which has been fixed.
   (merge 8d1549643e jc/http-sslkey-and-ssl-cert-are-paths later to maint).

 * Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
   been fixed.
   (merge de239446b6 jk/reflog-walk later to maint).

 * "git commit" when seeing an totally empty message said "you did not
   edit the message", which is clearly wrong.  The message has been
   corrected.
   (merge bc17f35f8c ks/commit-abort-on-empty-message-fix later to maint).

 * When a directory is not readable, "gitweb" fails to build the
   project list.  Work this around by skipping such a directory.
   (merge 46a13857fc hb/gitweb-project-list later to maint).

 * Some versions of GnuPG fails to kill gpg-agent it auto-spawned
   and such a left-over agent can interfere with a test.  Work it
   around by attempting to kill one before starting a new test.
   (merge 29ff1f8f74 st/lib-gpg-kill-stray-agent later to maint).

 * A recently added test for the "credential-cache" helper revealed
   that EOF detection done around the time the connection to the cache
   daemon is torn down were flaky.  This was fixed by reacting to
   ECONNRESET and behaving as if we got an EOF.
   (merge 1f180e5eb9 dl/credential-cache-socket-in-xdg-cache later to maint).

 * "git log --tag=no-such-tag" showed log starting from HEAD, which
   has been fixed---it now shows nothing.
   (merge 5d34d1ac06 jk/rev-list-empty-input later to maint).

 * The "tag.pager" configuration variable was useless for those who
   actually create tag objects, as it interfered with the use of an
   editor.  A new mechanism has been introduced for commands to enable
   pager depending on what operation is being carried out to fix this,
   and then "git tag -l" is made to run pager by default.
   (merge 595d59e2b5 ma/pager-per-subcommand-action later to maint).

 * "git push --recurse-submodules $there HEAD:$target" was not
   propagated down to the submodules, but now it is.
   (merge c7be7201a7 bw/push-options-recursively-to-submodules later to maint).

 * Commands like "git rebase" accepted the --rerere-autoupdate option
   from the command line, but did not always use it.  This has been
   fixed.
   (merge f826fb799e pw/sequence-rerere-autoupdate later to maint).

 * "git clone --recurse-submodules --quiet" did not pass the quiet
   option down to submodules.
   (merge 03c004c581 bw/clone-recursive-quiet later to maint).

 * Test portability fix for OBSD.
   (merge bed67874e2 rs/obsd-getcwd-workaround later to maint).
   (merge 4c7fda8fc1 rs/t4062-obsd later to maint).

 * Portability fix for OBSD.
   (merge 29c2eda80b rs/in-obsd-basename-dirname-take-const later to maint).

 * "git am -s" has been taught that some input may end with a trailer
   block that is not Signed-off-by: and it should refrain from adding
   an extra blank line before adding a new sign-off in such a case.
   (merge 735285b403 pw/am-signoff later to maint).

 * "git svn" used with "--localtime" option did not compute the tz
   offset for the timestamp in question and instead always used the
   current time, which has been corrected.
   (merge 1adc4b9a58 ur/svn-local-zone later to maint).

 * Memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged.
   (merge 83cd6f9017 rs/fsck-obj-leakfix later to maint).
   (merge 896dca3ab7 rs/unpack-entry-leakfix later to maint).
   (merge 149d8cbb2e rs/win32-syslog-leakfix later to maint).

 * "git stash -u" used the contents of the committed version of the
   ".gitignore" file to decide which paths are ignored, even when the
   file has local changes.  The command has been taught to instead use
   the locally modified contents.

 * bash 4.4 or newer gave a warning on NUL byte in command
   substitution done in "git stash"; this has been squelched.
   (merge 5fc92f8828 kd/stash-with-bash-4.4 later to maint).

 * "git grep -L" and "git grep --quiet -L" reported different exit
   codes; this has been corrected.
   (merge e1f68c66d5 as/grep-quiet-no-match-exit-code-fix later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
   (merge 5b114f3bb0 rs/bswap-ubsan-fix later to maint).
   (merge 168e63554c rs/move-array later to maint).
