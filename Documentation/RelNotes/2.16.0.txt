Git 2.16 Release Notes
======================

Backward compatibility notes and other notable changes.

 * Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
   'everything matches' is now an error.


Updates since v2.15
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * An empty string as a pathspec element that means "everything"
   i.e. 'git add ""', is now illegal.  We started this by first
   deprecating and warning a pathspec that has such an element in
   2.11 (Nov 2016).


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * An earlier update made it possible to use an on-stack in-core
   lockfile structure (as opposed to having to deliberately leak an
   on-heap one).  Many codepaths have been updated to take advantage
   of this new facility.
   (merge b74c90fb41 ma/lockfile-fixes later to maint).

 * Calling cmd_foo() as if it is a general purpose helper function is
   a no-no.  Correct two instances of such to set an example.
   (merge a92b1095d1 jc/no-cmd-as-subroutine later to maint).

 * We try to see if somebody runs our test suite with a shell that
   does not support "local" like bash/dash does.
   (merge 01d3a526ad mh/test-local-canary later to maint).


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.15
-----------------

 * "auto" as a value for the columnar output configuration ought to
   judge "is the output consumed by humans?" with the same criteria as
   "auto" for coloured output configuration, i.e. either the standard
   output stream is going to tty, or a pager is in use.  We forgot the
   latter, which has been fixed.
   (merge 965ff23a43 kd/auto-col-with-pager-fix later to maint).

 * The experimental "color moved lines differently in diff output"
   feature was buggy around "ignore whitespace changes" edges, whihch
   has been corrected.
   (merge b66b507292 jk/diff-color-moved-fix later to maint).

 * Instead of using custom line comparison and hashing functions to
   implement "moved lines" coloring in the diff output, use the pair
   of these functions from lower-layer xdiff/ code.
   (merge 01be97c2b2 sb/diff-color-moved-use-xdl-recmatch later to maint).

 * Some codepaths did not check for errors when asking what branch the
   HEAD points at, which have been fixed.
   (merge dbd2b55cb7 jk/misc-resolve-ref-unsafe-fixes later to maint).

 * "git commit", after making a commit, did not check for errors when
   asking on what branch it made the commit, which has been correted.
   (merge c26de08370 ao/check-resolve-ref-unsafe-result later to maint).

 * "git status --ignored -u" did not stop at a working tree of a
   separate project that is embedded in an ignored directory and
   listed files in that other project, instead of just showing the
   directory itself as ignored.
   (merge fadb4820c4 js/submodule-in-excluded later to maint).

 * A broken access to object databases in recent update to "git grep
   --recurse-submodules" has been fixed.
   (merge 9560e6245a bw/grep-recurse-submodules later to maint).

 * A recent regression in "git rebase -i" that broke execution of git
   commands from subdirectories via "exec" insn has been fixed.
   (merge 09d7b6c6fa jk/rebase-i-exec-gitdir-fix later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
   (merge bab76141da cn/diff-indent-no-longer-is-experimental later to maint).
