Git 2.22.1 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.22
-----------------

 * A relative pathname given to "git init --template=<path> <repo>"
   ought to be relative to the directory "git init" gets invoked in,
   but it instead was made relative to the repository, which has been
   corrected.

 * "git worktree add" used to fail when another worktree connected to
   the same repository was corrupt, which has been corrected.

 * The ownership rule for the file descriptor to fast-import remote
   backend was mixed up, leading to unrelated file descriptor getting
   closed, which has been fixed.

 * "git update-server-info" used to leave stale packfiles in its
   output, which has been corrected.

 * The server side support for "git fetch" used to show incorrect
   value for the HEAD symbolic ref when the namespace feature is in
   use, which has been corrected.

 * "git am -i --resolved" segfaulted after trying to see a commit as
   if it were a tree, which has been corrected.

 * "git bundle verify" needs to see if prerequisite objects exist in
   the receiving repository, but the command did not check if we are
   in a repository upfront, which has been corrected.

 * "git merge --squash" is designed to update the working tree and the
   index without creating the commit, and this cannot be countermanded
   by adding the "--commit" option; the command now refuses to work
   when both options are given.

 * The data collected by fsmonitor was not properly written back to
   the on-disk index file, breaking t7519 tests occasionally, which
   has been corrected.

 * Update to Unicode 12.1 width table.

 * The command line to invoke a "git cat-file" command from inside
   "git p4" was not properly quoted to protect a caret and running a
   broken command on Windows, which has been corrected.

 * "git request-pull" learned to warn when the ref we ask them to pull
   from in the local repository and in the published repository are
   different.

 * When creating a partial clone, the object filtering criteria is
   recorded for the origin of the clone, but this incorrectly used a
   hardcoded name "origin" to name that remote; it has been corrected
   to honor the "--origin <name>" option.

 * "git fetch" into a lazy clone forgot to fetch base objects that are
   necessary to complete delta in a thin packfile, which has been
   corrected.

 * The filter_data used in the list-objects-filter (which manages a
   lazily sparse clone repository) did not use the dynamic array API
   correctly---'nr' is supposed to point at one past the last element
   of the array in use.  This has been corrected.

 * The description about slashes in gitignore patterns (used to
   indicate things like "anchored to this level only" and "only
   matches directories") has been revamped.

 * The URL decoding code has been updated to avoid going past the end
   of the string while parsing %-<hex>-<hex> sequence.

 * The list of for-each like macros used by clang-format has been
   updated.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
